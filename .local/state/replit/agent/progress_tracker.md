# Trading Platform Migration - Progress Tracker

[x] 4533. WEBSOCKET PRICE STREAMING FIX - SEARCH MODE CHART! 🔌📊
[x] 4534. Date: December 1, 2025
[x] 4535. User Report: WebSocket prices not streaming in chart search mode
[x] 4536.
[x] 4537. ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED:
[x] 4538. - SSE connection was prioritizing selectedInstrument (invalid tokens)
[x] 4539. - In search mode, must use selectedJournalSymbol + Angel One token mapping
[x] 4540. - useEffect dependency was missing journalChartMode variable
[x] 4541.
[x] 4542. FIX #1 - SSE TOKEN SELECTION (Lines 5600-5628):
[x] 4543.    ✓ Added mode-aware token selection logic
[x] 4544.    ✓ IF search mode → Use selectedJournalSymbol with token mapping
[x] 4545.    ✓ ELSE if heatmap → Use selectedInstrument (dynamically selected)
[x] 4546.    ✓ ELSE fallback → Use hardcoded token mapping
[x] 4547.
[x] 4548. FIX #2 - USEEFFECT DEPENDENCIES (Line 5873):
[x] 4549.    ✓ Added journalChartMode to dependencies array
[x] 4550.    ✓ Now: [activeTab, selectedJournalSymbol, selectedJournalInterval, journalChartMode]
[x] 4551.    ✓ SSE properly reconnects when switching modes
[x] 4552.
[x] 4553. ✅ WEBSOCKET PRICE STREAMING FIXED!
[x] 4554.
[x] 4555. =========================================================
[x] 4556. INSTRUMENT LOADING FIX - NIFTY 50, BANKNIFTY, NSE/BSE/MCX/NCDEX/NFO/BFO/CDS! 📊✨
[x] 4557. Date: December 1, 2025
[x] 4558. User Report: NIFTY 50, BANKNIFTY, few stocks, index not loading in search
[x] 4559.                Make sure load everything - includes all exchanges
[x] 4560.
[x] 4561. ROOT CAUSE:
[x] 4562. - Token mapping was incomplete (only had few symbols)
[x] 4563. - Symbol lookup was failing for different naming formats
[x] 4564. - "NIFTY 50" from search didn't match 'NIFTY50' key in mapping
[x] 4565. - No direct token storage from search results
[x] 4566.
[x] 4567. FIX #1 - EXPANDED TOKEN MAPPING (Lines 5028-5057):
[x] 4568.    ✓ Added all NSE Indices:
[x] 4569.       • NIFTY50, NIFTY (both variants)
[x] 4570.       • BANKNIFTY, NIFTYIT, NIFTYNEXT50, NIFTYMIDCAP50
[x] 4571.       • INDIAVIX

[x] 4578.
[x] 4579. FIX #2 - IMPROVED SYMBOL NORMALIZATION (Lines 5063-5095):
[x] 4580.    ✓ Enhanced getJournalAngelOneSymbol() function
[x] 4581.    ✓ Removes all exchange prefixes: NSE:, BSE:, MCX:, NCDEX:, NFO:, BFO:, CDS:
[x] 4582.    ✓ Removes all suffixes: -EQ, -INDEX, -COM, -FUT, -OPT
[x] 4583.    ✓ Normalizes spaces and case: "Nifty 50" → "NIFTY50"
[x] 4584.    ✓ Fuzzy matching for variants
[x] 4585.
[x] 4586. FIX #3 - DIRECT TOKEN STORAGE (Lines 5060-5061):
[x] 4587.    ✓ New state: selectedInstrumentToken
[x] 4588.    ✓ Stores token directly from search API results
[x] 4589.    ✓ Bypasses lookup when token already known
[x] 4590.
[x] 4591. FIX #4 - PRIORITIZE DIRECT TOKENS IN CHART FETCH (Lines 5274-5290):
[x] 4592.    ✓ Try direct token first (from search results)
[x] 4593.    ✓ Fall back to symbol lookup if needed
[x] 4594.    ✓ Better error messages for debugging
[x] 4595.
[x] 4596. FIX #5 - STORE TOKEN ON SELECTION (Lines 11793-11797, 11905-11909):
[x] 4597.    ✓ Both default instruments (popular) and search results
[x] 4598.    ✓ Call setSelectedInstrumentToken when user selects
[x] 4599.    ✓ Token stored: { token, exchange, tradingSymbol }
[x] 4600.
[x] 4601. RESULT:
[x] 4602. ✅ NIFTY 50 loads instantly
[x] 4603. ✅ BANKNIFTY loads instantly
[x] 4604. ✅ All NSE stocks load (RELIANCE, TCS, HDFCBANK, etc.)
[x] 4605. ✅ BSE instruments load (SENSEX)
[x] 4606. ✅ MCX commodities load (GOLD, SILVER, CRUDEOIL)

[x] 4608. ✅ Search results from API parse correctly
[x] 4609. ✅ Symbol normalization handles all formats
[x] 4610.
[x] 4611. =========================================================
[x] 4612. CHART RENDERING FIX - DISPLAY CHART DATA WHEN LOADED! 📊✨
[x] 4613. Date: December 1, 2025
[x] 4614. User Report: Chart shows "No chart data available" placeholder even though data loads
[x] 4615.
[x] 4616. ROOT CAUSE:
[x] 4617. - Chart data fetched successfully (2477 candles logged)
[x] 4618. - But placeholder shown instead of rendering actual chart
[x] 4619. - Race condition: setJournalChartData([]) at fetch start caused placeholder to show
[x] 4620. - Fetch completes but chart effect wasn't properly tied to data completion
[x] 4621.
[x] 4622. FIXES APPLIED:
[x] 4623. FIX #1 - REMOVED DATA CLEARING ON FETCH START (Line 5269):
[x] 4624.    ✓ Deleted: setJournalChartData([]) before fetch
[x] 4625.    ✓ Prevents race condition where placeholder shows while fetching
[x] 4626.
[x] 4627. FIX #2 - DEFINED CLEANSYMBOL FOR LOGGING (Lines 5275-5284):
[x] 4628.    ✓ cleanSymbol was undefined when using direct token
[x] 4629.    ✓ Now always defined before use
[x] 4630.
[x] 4631. FIX #3 - IMPROVED AUTO-FETCH LOGIC (Lines 5371-5384):
[x] 4632.    ✓ Removed journalChartMode from dependencies to prevent re-trigger race
[x] 4633.    ✓ Set journalChartMode in auto-fetch instead of fetch function
[x] 4634.    ✓ Only depends on selectedJournalSymbol, activeTab, fetchJournalChartData
[x] 4635.
[x] 4636. FIX #4 - REMOVED PLACEHOLDER INTERFERENCE (Lines 5939-5942):
[x] 4637.    ✓ Removed innerHTML placeholder rendering that blocked chart display
[x] 4638.    ✓ Chart now renders immediately when data arrives
[x] 4639.    ✓ Loading indicator visible separately
[x] 4640.
[x] 4641. RESULT:
[x] 4642. ✅ Chart renders when data loads
[x] 4643. ✅ No more "No chart data available" placeholder blocking display
[x] 4644. ✅ RELIANCE, HDFCBANK, TCS, SENSEX, GOLD all show charts
[x] 4645. ✅ All instruments with tokens display historical candles
[x] 4646.
[x] 4647. ✅ WORKFLOW RESTARTED & RUNNING
[x] 4648. ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL - INSTRUMENTS LOAD → CHARTS RENDER INSTANTLY! 🚀✨

## NEO FEED FUNDAMENTAL CHART FIX - December 2, 2025 📊

[x] 1. Update getRealChartData() to use Angel One API ONLY (removed Fyers fallback)
[x] 2. Improved symbol normalization for token lookup
[x] 3. Added better time formatting based on timeframe (1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, 1Y)
[x] 4. Updated frontend placeholder message to show "Chart data via Angel One API"
[x] 5. Workflow restarted and verified

### Changes Made:
**Backend (server/routes.ts):**
- Removed all Fyers API fallback calls from getRealChartData()
- Now uses Angel One API exclusively for chart data
- Improved symbol cleaning: handles NSE:, BSE:, MCX: prefixes
- Better error messages when token not found or not authenticated
- Enhanced time label formatting per timeframe

**Frontend (neofeed-social-feed.tsx):**
- Updated placeholder text from "Yahoo Finance & Google Finance" to "Chart data via Angel One API"
- Added "Authenticate to view live charts" message

### Result:
✅ Chart data fetched via Angel One API only
✅ Line chart displays correctly when authenticated
✅ Removed dependency on Fyers API
✅ Clear messaging when authentication needed

### Additional Fix Applied - December 2, 2025:
[x] Added missing `getAngelOneInterval()` helper function (lines 3036-3060)
    - Converts user-friendly timeframes to Angel One API intervals:
    - 5m → FIVE_MINUTE
    - 15m → FIFTEEN_MINUTE
    - 1h → ONE_HOUR
    - 1D/1d → FIVE_MINUTE (intraday 5-min candles)
    - 5D/5d → THIRTY_MINUTE (30-min candles)
    - 1M → ONE_DAY (daily candles)
    - 6M/1Y/5Y → ONE_DAY (daily candles)

### Verified Working:
✅ TCS 1M: 21 data points via ONE_DAY interval
✅ TCS 1Y: 249 data points via ONE_DAY interval
✅ TCS 5D: 52 data points via THIRTY_MINUTE interval
✅ All timeframe buttons working in Fundamental window

=========================================================
## FUNDAMENTAL CHART IST TIMEZONE FIX - December 2, 2025 🕐

[x] 1. Fixed time scale on Fundamental window line chart to use IST timezone
[x] 2. Updated getRealChartData() function to convert timestamps to IST (UTC+5:30)
[x] 3. Workflow restarted and verified

### Changes Made:
**Backend (server/routes.ts) - Lines 3150-3160:**
- Added IST timezone conversion for all chart timestamps
- Converts UTC timestamps to IST (Indian Standard Time, UTC+5:30)
- Applied to all timeframe formats: 1D, 5D, 1M, 6M, 1Y

### Technical Details:
```javascript
// Convert to IST by adding 5 hours 30 minutes offset
const istOffset = 5.5 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 5 hours 30 minutes in milliseconds
const utcTime = timestamp.getTime() + (timestamp.getTimezoneOffset() * 60 * 1000);
const istTime = new Date(utcTime + istOffset);
```

### Result:
✅ Intraday charts now show correct IST time (e.g., 09:15, 15:30)
✅ 5-day charts show correct IST day and time
✅ All timeframes display in Indian Standard Time
