- These are expected limitations and do not affect core functionality

## Recent Changes:
- ✅ Firebase historical stock data storage DISABLED (saves storage costs)
- ✅ All historical data now stored in local PostgreSQL database only
- ✅ Existing Firebase data remains accessible via read operations
- ✅ To re-enable Firebase storage: Set GOOGLE_CLOUD_BACKUP_ENABLED=true in environment
