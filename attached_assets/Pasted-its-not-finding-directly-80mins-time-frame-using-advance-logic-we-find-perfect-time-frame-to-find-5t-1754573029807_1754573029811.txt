its not finding directly 80mins time frame using advance logic we find perfect time frame to find 5th,6th candles.let me exaplain logic again logic that i want to add on cycle 1,2,3 we used 4 candles c1,c1b,c2a,c2b with this we fond patterns 1-3,2-3,1-4,2-4 so now we do deep analysis power patterns are 1-3>2-4>1-4>2-3. 2-3 is waste pattern so we have compare pattern for uptrend and downtrend for better entry .on higher time frame we split down trend and uptrend pattern in internally into multiple pattern so that we can compare which trend is powerfull which trend is likely happen soon .i will tell clearly example 40 mins timeframe first 4 candle using this we detect patterns inorder to detect multiple patterns easy way to under stand is 40 mins time frame combination of multiple time 5,10,20 so same like that 40 mins time frame is combination of internal small time frames pattern how we identify small pattern we will discuss in next step 2

step 2 lets example todays nifty chart 40 mins first 4 candle with two blocks c1 and c2 block pattern we detected for downtrend is 1-3 and uptrend is 2-3 now we detect internal pattern so here we use block c2 3rd ,4th candles here we had 2 candle so we swith back to half time frame for 4 candles now 3rd 4th candle 40 mins each become 4 candles 20 mins candle time stamps 10:35 20 mins 4 candles internal pattern for down trend is 1-3 for uptrend is 1-4 now again split c2 block of 20 min into half find internal for 20 mins at 11:15 10 mins 4 candles internal pattern is for downtrend 2-3 for up trend 1-4 now compare all internal pattern based on that we find power pattern for 40 mins time frame patterns for down trend is (1-3,1-3,2-3) for uptrend(2-3,1-4,1-4) for downtrend 40mins,20 mins time frame is power full but 10mins time frame is week for uptrend 40 mins week but 20,10min strong while compraring both uptrend and down trend uptrend is more strong especially at 20,10 mins so we use 20 mins and 10 mins pattern to find 5th ,6th candles
