Here is the logic explained briefly and the steps to build it.

The Core Logic: A 3-Cycle Loop  

The scanner runs continuously from market open (9:15 AM IST) to close. It always begins on a 5-minute timeframe.

Let's call the current timeframe 'T'. Initially, T=5 minutes.

Cycle 1: Data Gathering (The "Wait" Phase)

Rule: Wait until 4 complete candles of the current timeframe (T) have formed.

Example (T=5 min): The scanner starts at 9:15 AM. It will wait until 9:35 AM, by which time the first four 5-minute candles (9:15-9:20, 9:20-9:25, 9:25-9:30, 9:30-9:35) are complete.

Cycle 2: Analysis (The "Find" Phase)

Rule: Using the first 4 candles as a baseline, analyze the 5th and 6th candles as they form 

we will discuss late about cycle 2

Cycle 3: Timeframe Transition (The "Zoom Out" Phase)

Rule: As soon as the 6th candle of timeframe T is complete, immediately double the timeframe: New T=T×2.

Critical Transition Step: The scanner re-evaluates its history. The 6 completed candles of the old timeframe become 3 candles of the new, doubled timeframe.

For instance, six 5-minute candles (30 minutes of data) perfectly form three 10-minute candles.

Loop: The scanner goes back to Cycle 1 with the new, larger timeframe.

Walkthrough Example Timeline

This timeline makes the process crystal clear:

9:15 AM: Scanner Starts. Timeframe T=5 min.

9:15 - 9:35 AM: (Cycle 1) Gathers the first 4 candles.

9:35 - 9:45 AM: (Cycle 2) Analyzes candles #5 and #6.

At 9:45 AM: (Cycle 3) 6th candle is complete. Timeframe becomes 10 min. The loop restarts.

9:45 AM: Scanner Starts New Loop. Timeframe T=10 min.

It checks history and sees that the data from 9:15 to 9:45 gives it 3 completed 10-min candles already.

9:45 - 9:55 AM: (Cycle 1) It only needs to wait for the 4th candle to complete (the 9:45-9:55 candle).

9:55 - 10:15 AM: (Cycle 2) Analyzes the 5th (9:55-10:05) and 6th (10:05-10:15) 10-minute candles.

At 10:15 AM: (Cycle 3) 6th candle is complete. Timeframe becomes 20 min. The loop restarts.

10:15 AM: Scanner Starts New Loop. Timeframe T=20 min.

It checks history from 9:15 AM to 10:15 AM (60 minutes of data). This gives it 3 completed 20-min candles.

10:15 - 10:35 AM: (Cycle 1) Waits for the 4th candle (10:15-10:35) to complete.

...and this process continues, doubling to 40 min, 80 min, etc., until the market closes.

How to Implement This Scanner

You cannot use a simple web-based scanner for this. You need to write code. The best approach is using Python.

Here are the essential components you'll need to code:

Data Connection: Use a broker's API (like Zerodha's Kite Connect, Alpaca, Finvasia, etc.) to get live 1-minute candle data for the stocks you want to scan.

State Management: Create variables in your code to keep track of the scanner's "memory":

current_timeframe (e.g., 5, 10, 20)

The OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data of the candles in the current cycle.

Time Resampling: This is the key technical step. Use the pandas library in Python. You will fetch 1-minute data and use the pandas.resample() function to group it into 5-min, 10-min, or 20-min candles as needed. This allows you to create any timeframe dynamically.

Main Loop: Write a master loop (while market_is_open:) that runs every minute. Inside the loop, it will:

Fetch the latest 1-minute data.

Resample all data into the current_timeframe.

Check how many candles are complete.

Execute the logic for Cycle 1, 2, or 3 based on the candle count.

Print alerts when your "find" condition is met.

Your first and most important development task is to clearly define the rules for your analysis in Cycle 2. What specific pattern are you looking for in candles 5 and 6? Once you have that, you can build the rest of the structure around it.
