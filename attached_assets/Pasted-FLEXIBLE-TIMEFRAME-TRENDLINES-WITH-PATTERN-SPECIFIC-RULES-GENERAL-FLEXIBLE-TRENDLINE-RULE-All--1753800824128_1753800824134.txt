FLEXIBLE TIMEFRAME TRENDLINES WITH PATTERN-SPECIFIC RULES:

GENERAL FLEXIBLE TRENDLINE RULE:
All patterns (1-3, 1-4, 2-4): Trendlines are flexible and adjust according to timeframe candles
Trendline endpoint: Extends to wherever the pattern naturally ends
Breakout level: Same as trendline endpoint
SPECIAL EXCEPTION - 2-3 PATTERN ONLY:
Trendline drawing: Draw to 4th candle (extended beyond natural endpoint)
Breakout level: Remains at 3rd candle (C2A level)
Reason: "Side-by-side" pattern characteristic requires extended trendline for better visualization while maintaining breakout at original Point B
COMPLETE RECURSIVE SYSTEM WITH FLEXIBLE TRENDLINES:
PATTERN-SPECIFIC TRENDLINE BEHAVIOR:
1-3 Pattern (Flexible):

Trendline: C1A → C2A (natural endpoint)
Breakout level: C2A (same as trendline endpoint)
Timeframe adjustment: Extends naturally with timeframe scaling
1-4 Pattern (Flexible):

Trendline: C1A → C2B (natural endpoint)
Breakout level: C2B (same as trendline endpoint)
Timeframe adjustment: Extends naturally with timeframe scaling
2-4 Pattern (Flexible):

Trendline: C1B → C2B (natural endpoint)
Breakout level: C2B (same as trendline endpoint)
Timeframe adjustment: Extends naturally with timeframe scaling
2-3 Pattern (SPECIAL EXCEPTION):

Trendline: C1B → extends to C2B (4th candle) - EXTENDED beyond natural endpoint
Breakout level: C2A (3rd candle) - REMAINS at original Point B
Timeframe adjustment: Trendline extends with scaling, breakout level stays at C2A
RECURSIVE DRILLING WITH FLEXIBLE TRENDLINES:
80min Example with 2-3 Pattern:
Level 1 - 80min Main Analysis:

2-3 Pattern detected: C1B → C2A (Point A to Point B)
Trendline: Drawn from C1B extending to C2B (4th candle, 80min)
Breakout level: Remains at C2A (3rd candle, 80min)
Level 2 - Recursive Drilling to 40min:

Split 80min C2 block → 4×40min sub-candles
2-3 Pattern in sub-analysis
Trendline: Extends to 4th sub-candle (40min)
Breakout level: Remains at 3rd sub-candle (40min)
Level 3 - Recursive Drilling to 20min:

Split 40min C2 block → 4×20min sub-candles
2-3 Pattern in sub-analysis
Trendline: Extends to 4th sub-candle (20min)
Breakout level: Remains at 3rd sub-candle (20min)
Level 4 - Final Drilling to 10min:

Split 20min C2 block → 4×10min sub-candles
2-3 Pattern in sub-analysis
Trendline: Extends to 4th sub-candle (10min)
Breakout level: Remains at 3rd sub-candle (10min)
DUAL TRENDLINE SYSTEM:
Higher trendline (80min): Most powerful, drawn to 4th candle
Lower trendlines (40min, 20min, 10min): Each level maintains 2-3 pattern rule
Breakout priority: All levels maintain breakout at 3rd candle position
Power hierarchy: 80min > 40min > 20min > 10min (for trade decisions)
