I've successfully implemented a sophisticated drag-and-drop block editor for fixing trade import format issues. This feature has been architect-reviewed and approved for production use.

🎯 What Was Built
Advanced Block Editor with full drag-and-drop functionality:

6 Column Headers: Time, Order, Symbol, Type, Qty, Price
Draggable Text Blocks: Create blocks by selecting text from your pasted trade data
Persistent Drop Zones: All columns + unassigned area remain droppable even when empty
Format Memory: Saves broker-specific mappings to localStorage and auto-applies them on reload
Visual Feedback: Hover states, drag overlays, validation indicators
📋 How to Use It
Go to Trade Book (on Home page)

Click "Import from Broker" button

Select your broker from dropdown

Paste your trade data into the text area

If auto-parsing fails, you'll see:

Live preview table showing the issue
Toggle button (Blocks icon) to switch to Block Editor mode
In Block Editor Mode:

Create blocks: Select text from your pasted data → blocks appear in "Unassigned" zone
Drag blocks: Drop them into correct column headers
Remap blocks: Drag them back to "Unassigned" if you make a mistake
Delete blocks: Click the X button on any block
Validation: Green checkmark appears when all required fields are mapped
Save & Import: Click "Save Format & Import" when complete

Your mapping is saved for this broker
Next time you import from the same broker, blocks auto-assign
🔧 Technical Highlights
@dnd-kit/core: Accessible drag-and-drop with keyboard support
Normalized State: Efficient block management
Persistence: localStorage with broker-specific keys
Token Index Mapping: Accurate position tracking for reliable auto-assignment
Always-Available Droppable: Unassigned zone never disappears, allowing full remapping flexibility
⚙️ Accessibility Features
Keyboard navigation support
Proper ARIA labels
data-testid attributes for automated testing
Visual feedback for drag operations
Note: The Fyers API errors in the logs are expected - they're from a background task fetching historical market data and don't affect the trade import functionality.

Your trading platform is now equipped with a production-ready block editor for handling any broker format! 🚀
